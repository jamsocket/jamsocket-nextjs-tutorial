# jamsocket-nextjs-tutorial

This repo is a starter repo for the Jamsocket NextJS + Socket.io Tutorial. The tutorial walks through how to use Jamsocket and Socket.io to add multiplayer presence and state-sharing features to a NextJS whiteboard app.

To try out a completed version of the whiteboard from this tutorial, check out the `completed` branch. Fill in the missing account value in `src/app/page.tsx`, run `npm install`, then run `npm run dev` and `npx jamsocket@latest dev` in separate terminal tabs and visit `http://localhost:3000`.

# NextJS + Socket.io Tutorial

Session backends are great for document-editing apps, which often load the entire document into memory and apply changes to the in-memory document. (Here, a document may be a text document, spreadsheet, vector graphic, image, or video, etc). For these kinds of applications, the session backend acts as a stateful layer between your client and storage (i.e. a database or blob store). The session backend is a place to...

- quickly handle edits to the in-memory document
- persist changes to your storage of choice in the background

This makes it easier to support collaborative editing features and synchronize your document state between several users and a backing store. Using a session backend to update an in-memory document during the user session also lets you use inexpensive blob storage (like S3) when the document is not being edited. (Read more about session backends in [our blogpost about them](https://driftingin.space/posts/session-lived-application-backends).)

Let's see how this can work by building a whiteboard app with multiplayer editing and presence features. Here's a little preview of what we're building in this tutorial:

![jamsocket-nextjs-demo](assets/jamsocket-nextjs-demo.gif "jamsocket-nextjs-demo"){ width="750px" }

Note: we'll be using [Docker's command-line tool](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), so get those installed if you haven't already. You'll also want to get a free Jamsocket API token. You can log in or create an account at [app.jamsocket.com](https://app.jamsocket.com), and create an API token on [the Settings page](https://app.jamsocket.com/settings).

## Setting up the starter repo

We've put together [a starter repo](https://github.com/drifting-in-space/jamsocket-nextjs-tutorial) for this tutorial that contains a NextJS app along with a few helper functions.

```
git clone https://github.com/drifting-in-space/jamsocket-nextjs-tutorial.git
cd jamsocket-nextjs-tutorial
```

In the project, you'll find a typical NextJS directory structure. We'll add code to the following three files:

- `src/app/page.tsx` - This is what gets rendered for the `/` path. For this tutorial, it'll be a React Server Component. We'll have it be responsible for starting up a session backend on Jamsocket.
- `src/components/Home.tsx` - This is the main client-side component for our app. It is rendered by the Server Component in `src/app/page.tsx` and will be responsible for the bulk of the app's functionality.
- `src/session-backend` - This directory contains the session backend logic. For this demo, the session backend will just be running a [SocketIO](https://socket.io) server that holds the state of the document in memory and receives/pushes document updates to/from the users who are currently editing it.

This repo also includes some helper components to kickstart our multiplayer demo:

- `src/components/Whiteboard.tsx` - This is a simple little whiteboard component that encapsulates the canvas and all the logic for creating and updating shapes from user interactions and for drawing other users' cursors to the screen.
- `src/components/Content.tsx`, `src/components/Header.tsx` - Some helper components for the styled elements of the demo.

Once you've cloned the repo, run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then you should be able to open the app in your browser on localhost with the port shown in the command output (probably `http://localhost:3000`).

If everything works, you'll notice you can create shapes by clicking and dragging on the page. You can move existing shapes by dragging them. 

At this point, you're probably wondering if "whiteboard" isn't overselling it a bit. And you would be right. Implementing a full whiteboard application will be an exercise left to the reader, but, for now, this very limited whiteboard should serve us well as a demo for implementing state sharing and presence features with session backends.

Speaking of state-sharing and presence features - you'll notice that opening the app in another tab gives you a completely blank canvas. Let's see if we can't get this app to share the state of the whiteboard with other tabs.

## Writing our session backend

Let's start by adding presence to our application. When another user enters the document, we want to see their cursor on the canvas and their avatar up in corner of the screen.

Since the session backend will be our source of truth for the document state, let's start there.

In `src/session-backend/index.ts` we're already importing `socket.io`, starting a WebSocket server on port 8080, and listening for new connections. Let's add some code that keeps track of which users are currently connected and emit an event to all the clients when a user connects or disconnects.

```ts title="src/session-backend/index.ts" hl_lines="1 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22"
const users: Set<{ id: string; socket: Socket }> = new Set()
io.on('connection', (socket: Socket) => {
  console.log('New user connected:', socket.id)
  
  // store each user's socket connection and user id (socket.id will be the stand in for user id)
  const newUser = { id: socket.id, socket }
  users.add(newUser)

  // send all existing users a 'user-entered' event for the new user
  socket.broadcast.emit('user-entered', newUser.id)

  // send the new user a 'user-entered' event for each existing user
  for (const user of users) {
    newUser.socket.emit('user-entered', user.id)
  }

  // when a user disconnects, delete the user from our set
  // and broadcast a 'user-exited' event to all the other users
  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    users.delete(newUser)
    socket.broadcast.emit('user-exited', newUser.id)
  })
})
```

Now that we've got a simple backend written, it's time to shift our focus to the application code for our NextJS project.

We need to do two things:

1. get our server component to spawn a new backend when someone opens the whiteboard, and
2. update our client-side logic to connect to the session backend and listen for our `user-entered` and `user-exited` WebSocket events.

## Create a Jamsocket service

Before we set up our server component, we'll need to get a few things set up to spawn backends.

Let's log in to the Jamsocket CLI and create a new service for our whiteboard demo called, well, `whiteboard-demo`. When you spawn a backend, you refer to it by its service name. Jamsocket uses the service name (and optionally, a provided tag) to find the appropriate version of your session backend code to run. If you were building a real application, you would probably want a service just for development and another service for production. That way you don't affect the users of your production service while you are iterating on the code in your development service. When you're done developing, you can build your session backend's docker image and push it to your production service with the Jamsocket CLI.

```
npx jamsocket@latest login
npx jamsocket@latest service create whiteboard-demo
```

## Spawning our session backend

In our Page component, let's import `@jamsocket/javascript/server`. It contains helper functions that we can use when spawning and communicating with session backends. It's important that we spawn from server code as eventually we'll be using an API token that we want to keep secret, so let's use our React Server Component (`src/app/page.tsx`). Notice that when we import our library, we'll be specifically using the `/server` subpath.

```ts title="src/app/page.tsx"
import 'server-only'
import { init } from '@jamsocket/javascript/server'

const spawnBackend = init({
  account: [FILL ME IN],
  service: 'whiteboard-demo',
  // NOTE: we want to keep the Jamsocket token secret, so we can only do this in a server component
  // We'll leave this blank for now, since we don't need it when developing with the dev CLI
  token: ''
})
```

The `init` function here takes three arguments:

* an account name - that's the account name you created when you signed up for Jamsocket (which you can find on [the Settings page](https://app.jamsocket.com/settings) in case you forgot)
* a service name - that's the name of the service we just created - `whiteboard-demo`
* an api token - we can leave this blank for now as the Jamsocket dev CLI will take care of authentication while we're development. When it's time to go to production, we can get an API token from [the Settings page](https://app.jamsocket.com/settings).

And it returns a `spawnBackend()` function that we'll use to, well, spawn a backend. It takes a single, optional `spawnOptions` argument. These `spawnOptions` are just camel-cased versions of the options accepted by the HTTP spawn API. (Our docs have more information about [spawn options for the HTTP API](https://docs.jamsocket.com/platform/reference#spawn-a-service).) For now, we will only use one of those spawn options: `lock`. You can learn more about spawning with locks [here](https://docs.jamsocket.com/concepts/locks), but for now it suffices to say that we'll just use a document name. And for this demo, we'll just have one document that everybody edits called `whiteboard-demo/default`.

The result of the `spawnBackend()` function contains a URL that you can use to connect to the session backend, a status URL which returns the current status of the session backend, and some other values like the backend's name and an optional bearer token which is useful when authenticating client requests to a session backend. (We aren't using these bearer tokens in this demo, but you can learn more about them [here](https://docs.jamsocket.com/concepts/auth-with-backend)).

Note that `Page` is rendered in a server-side component. This ensures that your secrets aren't leaked to the client. Once we receive the spawn result, the `Page` component will pass that information to the `HomeContainer` component. 

```ts title="src/app/page.tsx" hl_lines="4 15 16"
import 'server-only'
import { init } from '@jamsocket/javascript/server'

const WHITEBOARD_NAME = 'whiteboard-demo/default'

const spawnBackend = init({
  account: [FILL ME IN],
  service: 'whiteboard-demo',
  // NOTE: we want to keep the Jamsocket token secret, so we can only do this in a server component
  // We'll leave this blank for now, since we don't need it when developing with the dev CLI
  token: ''
})

export default async function Page() {
  const spawnResult = await spawnBackend({ lock: WHITEBOARD_NAME })
  return <HomeContainer spawnResult={spawnResult} />
}
```

!!! warning "Notice"
    At this point, the typechecker will have some complaints. Let's fix those in the next section.

## Connecting to our session backend

To connect to our session backend, the `HomeContainer` component should accept `spawnResult` as props and pass that into the `SessionBackendProvider`. The `SessionBackendProvider` lets us use the React hooks in `@jamsocket/javascript/react` to interact with the session backend. 

```ts title="src/components/Home.tsx"
import { SessionBackendProvider } from '@jamsocket/javascript/react'
import type { SpawnResult } from '@jamsocket/javascript/types'

export default function HomeContainer({ spawnResult }: { spawnResult: SpawnResult }) {
  return <SessionBackendProvider spawnResult={spawnResult}>
    <Home />
  </SessionBackendProvider>
}
```
Next, let's keep track of which users are in the document with some component state. And we can pass that list of users to our `AvatarList` component which will render an avatar in the header for each user who is currently in the document.

```ts title="src/components/Home.tsx" hl_lines="1 2 9 12 13 14"
import type { Shape, User } from '../types'
import {AvatarList} from './Whiteboard'

// ...

function Home() {
  const ready = true // we'll replace this with a real check later
  const [shapes, setShapes] = useState<Shape[]>([])
  const [users, setUsers] = useState<User[]>([])
  return (
    <main>
      <Header>
        <AvatarList users={users} />
      </Header>
      <Content>
      // ...
  )
}
```

Now, in our `Home` component, we can use the `useEventListener` hook to listen for our `user-entered` and `user-exited` events we're sending from our session backend.

```ts title="src/components/Home.tsx"
import { SessionBackendProvider, useEventListener } from '@jamsocket/javascript/react'
```

Then we can subscribe to the events with our hook. On the `user-entered` event, we should create a user object with an `id` and a `cursorX` and `cursorY` property (we'll use these when we implement cursor presence). And on the `user-exited` event, let's just remove the user from the list of users in our component state.

```ts title="src/components/Home.tsx" hl_lines="6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13"
function Home() {
  const ready = true // we'll replace this with a real check later
  const [shapes, setShapes] = useState<Shape[]>([])
  const [users, setUsers] = useState<User[]>([])

  useEventListener<string>('user-entered', (id) => {
    const newUser = { cursorX: null, cursorY: null, id }
    setUsers((users) => [...users, newUser])
  })

  useEventListener<string>('user-exited', (id) => {
    setUsers((users) => users.filter((p) => p.id !== id))
  })

  // ...
}
```

Let's also import the `useReady` hook that we can use to show a spinner while the session backend is starting up. Depending on your application, it may or may not make sense to show a spinner, but for this demo we'll take the simpler approach of ensuring the session backend is running and the inital document state is loaded before the user can start editing it.

```ts title="src/components/Home.tsx" hl_lines="1 6"
import { SessionBackendProvider, useEventListener, useReady } from '@jamsocket/javascript/react'

// ...

function Home() {
  const ready = useReady()
  const [shapes, setShapes] = useState<Shape[]>([])
  // ...
}
```

Finally - the moment of truth. Let's start the Jamsocket dev CLI to see if everything works! In another terminal window:

```
npx jamsocket@latest dev
```

The dev CLI does several things to make development easier, the first of which is automatically rebuilding our session backend Docker image when the code changes. When you run `npx jamsocket@latest dev`, the first thing it does is build your session backend code and push to the Jamsocket container registry.

Let's take a quick look at the `jamsocket.config.js` file in the project root to see how all this works:

```js title="jamsocket.config.js"
module.exports = {
  dockerfile: './Dockerfile.jamsocket',
  service: 'whiteboard-demo',
  watch: ['./src/session-backend']
}
```

This config file is used by the dev CLI so it knows (1) what Dockerfile to use to build the session backend, (2) what Jamsocket service to push the Docker image to, and (3) which parts of the file system to watch for changes.

So in our demo, the dev CLI will watch the `src/session-backend` directory, and when a change is detected, it will build the `Dockerfile.jamsocket` Dockerfile. Then it will push the resulting Docker image to the Jamsocket container registry for your `whiteboard-demo` service.

If you're interested in learning how to manually build and push your docker image to the Jamsocket registry, check out [the Hello World Tutorial](https://docs.jamsocket.com/quickstart) which has a simple example.

The second thing the dev CLI does for us is keep track of session backends we've spawned during development, terminating backends that are running old code, and streaming status updates and logs from your session backend. It does this by running a proxy server that we'll use when spawning. To make that work, let's pass in an `apiUrl` to our Jamsocket `init()` function in `page.tsx`:

```ts title="src/app/page.tsx" hl_lines="7"
const spawnBackend = init({
  account: [FILL ME IN],
  service: 'whiteboard-demo',
  // NOTE: we want to keep the Jamsocket token secret, so we can only do this in a server component
  // We'll leave this blank for now, since we don't need it when developing with the dev CLI
  token: '',
  apiUrl: 'http://localhost:8080'
})
```

(Note: when it comes time to make this app production-ready, you'll likely want to check an environment variable and only set `apiUrl` in a development environment.)

Now with both Jamsocket dev CLI and `npm run dev` running in separate terminal windows, you should be able to refresh the page and see an avatar in the header. And if you open the app in another window, another avatar should appear. Note that it may take a second for the backend to start up initially. (On the paid tier, images are cached on the servers that spawn them which make the startup times much faster. [Contact us](hi@driftingin.space) about moving to a paid plan.)

If you take a look at the terminal window running the dev CLI, you should see that our server component spawned a backend and now its statuses and logs are appearing in the dev CLI output.

## Implementing cursor presence

Most of the hard work is behind us, so let's add a few more events. Let's keep track of the cursor position for each user so we can display that on top of the whiteboard.

We'll start by subscribing to a `cursor-position` event and updating our list of users with the user passed to it:

```ts title="src/components/Home.tsx" hl_lines="6 7 8"
function Home() {
  const ready = useReady()
  const [shapes, setShapes] = useState<Shape[]>([])
  const [users, setUsers] = useState<User[]>([])

  useEventListener<User>('cursor-position', (user) => {
    setUsers((users) => users.map((p) => p.id === user.id ? user : p))
  })

// ...
}
```

Then we need to send a `cursor-position` event to the session backend as our cursor moves over the whiteboard.

We can do this by importing the `useSend` hook and then creating a `sendEvent` function with it:

```ts title="src/components/Home.tsx" hl_lines="1 5"
import { SessionBackendProvider, useEventListener, useReady, useSend } from '@jamsocket/javascript/react'

function Home() {
  const ready = useReady()
  const sendEvent = useSend()
  const [shapes, setShapes] = useState<Shape[]>([])
  const [users, setUsers] = useState<User[]>([])
  // ...
}
```

Then, we can pass a `users` prop and an `onCursorMove` prop to our `<Whiteboard>` component, that takes the cursor's position and sends it to our session backend.

```ts title="src/components/Home.tsx" hl_lines="3 4 5 6"
<Whiteboard
  shapes={shapes}
  users={users}
  onCursorMove={(position) => {
    sendEvent('cursor-position', { x: position?.x, y: position?.y })
  }}
/>
```

Now we just need to add a `cursor-position` event to our session backend code. In our `src/session-backend/index.ts` file let's subscribe to the `cursor-position` event and emit a `cursor-position` event to all connected clients. We can use `volatile.broadcast` here because it's okay if we drop a couple `cursor-position` events here and there. For cursor positions, we really just care about the most recent cursor position message.

```ts title="src/session-backend/index.ts" hl_lines="3 4 5"
io.on('connection', (socket: Socket) => {
  console.log('New user connected:', socket.id)
  socket.on('cursor-position', ({ x, y }) => {
    socket.volatile.broadcast.emit('cursor-position', { id: socket.id, cursorX: x, cursorY: y })
  })
  // ...
})
```

Okay, with that, let's take a look at our dev CLI. If it's still running, it should have rebuilt and pushed our session backend code to Jamsocket. It should have also terminated any previous backends running with out of date code.

Now, if we open the application in a new browser window, we should see a new session backend spawning in the dev CLI. If everything works, moving your cursor over one canvas should show a moving cursor on the other client. However, the shapes you create in one window don't appear in the other. Let's fix that in the next section by implementing state sharing across clients.

## Implementing shared state

The last thing we want to do in this demo is implement state-sharing. Right now, when you refresh the page, you lose all the shapes you've drawn. And when another connected client draws shapes, you can't see them. Let's fix that.

This time, we'll start with our session backend code. Let's create an array to store all the shapes. When a new user connects, we'll send them a snapshot of all the shapes. Let's also listen for two new events: `create-shape` and `update-shape`, which will update our list of shapes accordingly.

```ts title="src/session-backend/index.ts" hl_lines="1 5 8 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27"
import type { Shape } from '../types'

// ...

const shapes: Shape[] = []
io.on('connection', (socket: Socket) => {
  console.log('New user connected:', socket.id)
  socket.emit('snapshot', shapes)

  socket.on('cursor-position', ({ x, y }) => {
    socket.volatile.broadcast.emit('cursor-position', { id: socket.id, cursorX: x, cursorY: y })
  })

  socket.on('create-shape', (shape: Shape) => {
    shapes.push(shape)
    socket.broadcast.emit('snapshot', shapes)
  })

  socket.on('update-shape', (updatedShape: Shape) => {
    const shape = shapes.find(s => s.id === updatedShape.id)
    if (!shape) return
    shape.x = updatedShape.x
    shape.y = updatedShape.y
    shape.w = updatedShape.w
    shape.h = updatedShape.h
    socket.broadcast.emit('update-shape', shape)
  })
})
```

Now, let's add our `sendEvent()` and `useEventListener()` calls to the `Home` component.

First, we should listen for our new `snapshot` and `update-shape` events:

```ts title="src/components/Home.tsx" hl_lines="6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16"
function Home() {
  const ready = useReady()
  const [shapes, setShapes] = useState<Shape[]>([])
  const [users, setUsers] = useState<User[]>([])

  useEventListener<Shape[]>('snapshot', (shapes) => {
    setShapes(shapes)
  })

  useEventListener<Shape>('update-shape', (shape) => {
    setShapes((shapes) => {
      const shapeToUpdate = shapes.find((s) => s.id === shape.id)
      if (!shapeToUpdate) return [...shapes, shape]
      return shapes.map((s) => s.id === shape.id ? { ...s, ...shape } : s)
    })
  })
  // ... 
}
```

Then in our `onCreateShape` and `onUpdateShape` Whiteboard props, we should send the appropriate event to the session backend:

```ts title="src/components/Home.tsx" hl_lines="8 12"
<Whiteboard
  shapes={shapes}
  users={users}
  onCursorMove={(position) => {
    sendEvent('cursor-position', { x: position?.x, y: position?.y })
  }}
  onCreateShape={(shape) => {
    sendEvent('create-shape', shape)
    setShapes([...shapes, shape])
  }}
  onUpdateShape={(id, shape) => {
    sendEvent('update-shape', { id, ...shape })
    setShapes((shapes) => shapes.map((s) => s.id === id ? { ...s, ...shape } : s))
  }}
/>
```

Now, the dev CLI should have updates our session backend code in Jamsocket and removed old session backends we had spawned for development. We should be able to simply open the app in a few browser windows and see:

* an avatar for each user
* each user's cursor as it hovers over the whiteboard
* all the same shapes as they are created and moved around the screen
